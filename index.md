# Mental Models for Teams

## Welcome

### Who are we?

We are a group of computer-science students at the DHBW Karlsruhe and are creating this website as a part of our project management course.

### Why are we doing this?

Our goal with this website is to create a useful resource for future students and everyone else who is interested to use. <br> As human beings our most important resource is
our mind. To use it more effectively we want to provide you with some useful tools: Mental Models.
