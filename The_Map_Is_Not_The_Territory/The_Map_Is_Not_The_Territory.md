# The Map Is Not The Territory

- The map is not the territory metaphorically illustrates the differences between belief and reality.
- The phrase was coined by Alfred Korzybski.
- Our perception of the world is being generated by our brain and can be considered as a 'map' of reality written in neural patterns.
- Reality exists outside our mind but we can construct models of this 'territory' based on what we glimpse through our senses.

## In Korzybskiâ€™s words

1. A map may have a structure similar or dissimilar to the structure of the territory.

2. Two similar structures have similar â€˜logicalâ€™ characteristics. Thus, if in a correct map, Dresden is given as between Paris and Warsaw, a similar relation is found in the actual territory.

3. A map is not the actual territory.

4. An ideal map would contain the map of the map, the map of the map of the map, etc., endlesslyâ€¦We may call this characteristic self-reflexiveness.

## Limitations according to Korzybski

1. The map could be **incorrect** without us realizing it.

2. The map is, by necessity, a **reduction of the actual thing**, a process in which you lose certain important information.

3. A map needs **interpretation**, a process that can cause major errors.

## What you should take from it

This principle basically shows that we always work with a map, but if we change the map then the territory hasn't necissarily changed. Sometimes people tend to change the map in a way which fits for their goals but actually is wrong. E.g. Removing a mountain from the map because you'd like to pass there. So always make sure that your map is always as simmilar to the actual territory as possible in order to be able to make good decisions and forsee their outcome.
