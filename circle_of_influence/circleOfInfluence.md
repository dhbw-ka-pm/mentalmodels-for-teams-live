# Circle Of Influence

üí° Circle of influence refers to the area of your life where you can actually make changes. It is that circle of your life where you focus your energy to become your best version. It also helps to regain your control of important things.

Those who effectively embrace change, focus their time and energy on things they actually have control over, instead of wasting their time and energy on things they don‚Äôt.
