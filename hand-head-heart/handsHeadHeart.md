# Hand, Head & Heart
![](drawings/Head-Heart-Hand.png)
## Introduction

Head, Heart & Hand is a mental model that stands for the three components of motivation (3C).

 - **Head** represents our rationally derived intentions, our goals and the commitment to enact a certain action.
 _"Is this activity really important to me?"_

 - **Heart** represents the emotional sphere; the fun and pleasure associated with an activity; unconscious needs and motives, but also fears underlying an activity.
_"Do I really like this activity?"_

 - **Hand** represents skills and abilities, action-related knowledge and experiences with respect to the activity at hand.
_"Am I good at this activity?"_

## Application
The following graphic illustrates how these three aspects of motivation contribute to the best productivity and / or wellbeing of each collaborator. It is the goal of every project manager to achieve the status, represented by the white triangle in the middle for the entire team.
