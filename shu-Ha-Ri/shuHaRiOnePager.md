# Shu-Ha-Ri

## General information

Shu Ha Ri is an ancient japanese martial arts concept \
It describes the three stages of learning to mastery. \
This concept is said to go back to KAWAKAMI FUHAKU (1719-1807).


## Brief explaination/ Idea behind this concept

### Shu
Follow/Learn/Obey

Basics, introductions, rules and techniques\
are learned, practiced and followed\
in a disciplined and repeated manner.

### Ha
Detaching from the standards and breaking with tradition

HA is the stage where one has learned the techniques and now \
starts to question and understand the background of the techniques and forms. \
When the learner is ready, he should adapt (and even break) certain rules\
to achieve the best results possible.

### Ri
Transcend

In Ri, the "learner" has fully absorbed the knowledge of his teacher\
and has matures into a master himself. \
It is possible now, to follow his own view about the procedure.\
never forget the essence





## Representation of the mental model

![](Shu-Ha-Ri.svg)

```
Each circle represents one of the Shu-Ha-Ri phases. In the first phase,
your scope is restrained and you just follow the rules. In the second phase, 
your scope is widened and you break some of the rules in order to
try things out. In the third phase, you widen your scope to the maximum by 
creating your own environment with its own rules. 
```
