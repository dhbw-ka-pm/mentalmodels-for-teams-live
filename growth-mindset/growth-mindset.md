# Growth Mindset

When you have a growth mindset you believe that your abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort.
It means that you thrive on challenge, and don’t see failure as a way to describe yourself but as a springboard for growth and developing your abilities.
Additionally, growing at work, and outside work is essential.

I've found that taking time to evaluate what I'm doing helps me stay on track with my work. When I notice myself losing focus, I try to remind myself that short-term frustration will likely lead to long-term improvement in my skills - if I just keep at it. A growth mindset 
opens one up to more creativity and possibilities, and I find that I can achieve more and set higher goals.

In comparison to the growth mindset, the fixed mindset views talents, intelligence and capabilities as static and unchangeable.

## How to get a growth mindset?

### 1. Challenges
Stop avoiding challenges and face them instead

### 2. Obstacles
Once you hit a roadblock stand up, put down whatever project is sucking the gumption out of you, walk away, and return when you’re feeling more inspired

### 3. Effort
The phrase “no pain, no gain” is pure growth mindset!
Would you rather shower off pangs of regret, or the sweat of accomplishment? C’mon, the answers are obvious.

### 4. Criticism
Ask yourself two questions:
1. What was the best part of the day?
2. What went wrong, and how can I make sure it does not happen again?

### 5. Success of others
Giving other people credit for success and appreciating their skills without feeling jealous. 
Also, you can use these skills to complement/improve your skills (especially important in a company/team).
